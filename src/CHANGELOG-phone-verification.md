### For Developers

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing endpoints work the same
- Phone search still functions
- User discovery unchanged
- Same response formats

**New Response Fields:**
```typescript
// /phone/send-otp now returns:
{
  success: true,
  otp: "123456",        // Demo only
  email: "user@example.com",  // NEW: shows where code was sent
  message: "OTP sent to your email successfully"
}
```

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

### Current State (Demo Mode)
âœ… OTP generated correctly
âœ… Email logged to console
âœ… OTP displayed in UI for testing
âœ… Full country support active
âœ… Phone search working

### Production Readiness

To enable real email sending, integrate an email service:

**Recommended: Resend**
```bash
npm install resend
```

**Update `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`:**
```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(Deno.env.get('RESEND_API_KEY'));

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'AuroraLink <verify@auroralink.app>',
  to: userProfile.email,
  subject: 'Your AuroraLink Verification Code',
  html: `
    <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding: 20px;">
      <h2>Phone Number Verification</h2>
      <p>Your verification code is:</p>
      <h1 style="font-size: 32px; letter-spacing: 8px; color: #0057FF;">${otp}</h1>
      <p style="color: #6B7280;">This code will expire in 10 minutes.</p>
      <p style="color: #6B7280;">If you didn't request this code, please ignore this email.</p>
    </div>
  `
});

// Remove these in production:
// - Don't return OTP in response
// - Don't console.log the OTP
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
