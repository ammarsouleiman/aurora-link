## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Counts Not Updating?
- **Wait 3 seconds** - Auto-refresh happens every 3 seconds
- **Check connection** - Make sure you're online
- **Reload the app** - Force close and reopen if needed

### Seeing Wrong Counts?
- Counts are accurate from this build forward
- Old posts before this update won't affect the count
- New posts/follows will be tracked correctly

## 💡 Tips

1. **No Need to Refresh** - Counts update automatically
2. **Wait a Moment** - Give it 3 seconds after an action
3. **Check Console** - Logs show count updates (for debugging)
4. **Toast Messages** - Look for success messages after actions

## 🎨 New Features

### Enhanced Feedback
- 🎉 Special message when you become friends (mutual follow)
- ✅ Clear success indicators
- 📊 Console logs for debugging (check browser DevTools)

### Auto-Refresh
- Refreshes every 3 seconds
- Works on your profile and others' profiles
- Only refreshes when profile screen is open
- Stops when you navigate away (saves battery/data)

## 📱 User Flow Example

**Scenario: You accept a follow request from "Alice"**

1. Open Activity (notifications) screen
2. See: "Alice requested to follow you"
3. Tap "Accept"
4. See: "Follow request accepted ✅"
5. Navigate to your Profile
6. Within 3 seconds, Followers count: 45 → 46
7. Navigate to Alice's profile
8. See "Friends • You follow each other" (if you follow her back)

## 🚀 Best Practices

1. **Give it a moment** - Wait 3 seconds for counts to refresh
2. **Check your profile** - Navigate to profile to see updated counts
3. **Don't spam actions** - Wait for one action to complete
4. **Trust the system** - Counts are accurate, just need a moment to update

## ⚡ What's Automatic

- ✅ Follower count updates
- ✅ Following count updates  
- ✅ Posts count updates
- ✅ Friend status detection
- ✅ Profile data refresh
- ✅ No manual refresh needed!

## 🎯 Summary
