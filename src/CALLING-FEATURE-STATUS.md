# 📞 Calling Feature Status

## Current Status: Coming Soon 🚀

The voice and video calling features are currently **disabled** and show a "Coming Soon" message to users.

---

## What Users See

### When Clicking Call Buttons
- **Voice Call Button** (phone icon): Shows toast message "Coming Soon! 🚀" with description "Voice calling feature will be available soon. Stay tuned!"
- **Video Call Button** (video icon): Shows toast message "Coming Soon! 🚀" with description "Video calling feature will be available soon. Stay tuned!"

### User Experience
- ✅ Call buttons are **visible** in conversation screens
- ✅ Buttons are **clickable** but show info message
- ✅ Professional toast notification appears
- ✅ No error messages or confusing states
- ✅ Clear communication that feature is coming

---

## Technical Implementation

### Disabled Functions
The following functions now show "Coming Soon" instead of initiating calls:

**`handleInitiateCall()`** - `/App.tsx`
```typescript
const handleInitiateCall = async (recipient: UserType, callType: 'voice' | 'video') => {
  toast.info('Coming Soon! 🚀', {
    description: `${callType === 'video' ? 'Video' : 'Voice'} calling feature will be available soon. Stay tuned!`,
  });
};
```

**`handleAcceptCall()`** - `/App.tsx`
```typescript
const handleAcceptCall = async () => {
  setIncomingCall(null);
  toast.info('Coming Soon! 🚀', {
    description: 'Voice and video calling will be available soon. Stay tuned!',
  });
};
```

### Disabled Features
- ❌ Incoming call polling (disabled)
- ❌ Permission dialogs (not shown)
- ❌ WebRTC connection setup (skipped)
- ❌ Call screen rendering (disabled)
- ❌ Signal polling (disabled)

### What Still Exists (For Future Use)
The full calling infrastructure is **preserved** but not active:
- ✅ CallScreen component (`/components/screens/CallScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ IncomingCallDialog component (`/components/IncomingCallDialog.tsx`)
- ✅ PermissionRequestDialog component (`/components/PermissionRequestDialog.tsx`)
- ✅ WebRTC utilities (`/utils/webrtc.ts`)
- ✅ Backend API routes (in `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Call types and interfaces (`/utils/types.ts`)

## Re-Enabling Calling (When Ready)

### Quick Steps

To re-enable calling when ready for production:

1. **Restore `handleInitiateCall`**
   - Replace the "Coming Soon" version with the full implementation
   - See `/CALL-FIXES-APPLIED.md` for the complete code

2. **Restore `handleAcceptCall`**
   - Replace with full WebRTC setup code
   - See `/CALL-FIXES-APPLIED.md` for details

3. **Re-enable Call Polling**
   - Restore the useEffect that polls for incoming calls
   - See `/CALL-FIXES-APPLIED.md` for the polling code

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Follow `/TESTING-CALLS.md` for comprehensive testing
   - Verify permissions work correctly
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices

- `/CALL-FIXES-APPLIED.md` - All fixes and implementations
- `/TESTING-CALLS.md` - Testing procedures
- `/CALL-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Debugging guide

---

## Why Disabled?

The calling feature was temporarily disabled to show a "Coming Soon" message while:
- ✅ Preventing permission errors during development
- ✅ Managing user expectations
- ✅ Allowing gradual rollout when ready
- ✅ Avoiding incomplete feature frustration

---

## User Communication

### Toast Messages

**Outgoing Calls:**
```
Title: "Coming Soon! 🚀"
Description: "Voice calling feature will be available soon. Stay tuned!"
or
Description: "Video calling feature will be available soon. Stay tuned!"
```

**Incoming Calls (if any):**
```
Title: "Coming Soon! 🚀"
Description: "Voice and video calling will be available soon. Stay tuned!"
```

### UI State
- Phone and video icons remain visible in conversations
- Icons are fully interactive (not disabled/greyed out)
- Clean, professional user experience
- No error states or confusion

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### User Experience
- ✅ **Clear Communication**: Users know feature is coming
- ✅ **No Errors**: No permission errors or failed states
- ✅ **Professional**: Clean toast notifications
- ✅ **Discoverable**: Buttons visible so users know calls will exist

### Development
- ✅ **Easy to Enable**: Just restore the original functions
- ✅ **Clean Codebase**: All infrastructure preserved
- ✅ **Gradual Rollout**: Can enable for beta users first
- ✅ **Safe**: No half-working features confusing users

### Testing
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: App still works perfectly
- ✅ **Easy to Test**: Enable temporarily for testing
- ✅ **Feature Flags**: Easy to implement feature flag later

---

## Future Enhancements

When re-enabling, consider:

1. **Feature Flag System**
   ```typescript
   const CALLING_ENABLED = false; // or from backend config
   
   if (CALLING_ENABLED) {
     // Full calling implementation
   } else {
     // Coming soon message
   }
   ```

2. **Beta Testing**
   - Enable for specific users first
   - Gather feedback before full rollout
   - Monitor performance and errors

3. **Announcement Strategy**
   - In-app announcement when enabled
   - Tutorial or tooltip on first use
   - Email/notification to users

## Documentation

All calling documentation is preserved:
- 📖 `/VOICE-VIDEO-CALLS-GUIDE.md` - Complete guide
- 🔧 `/CALL-FIXES-APPLIED.md` - Implementation details
- 🧪 `/TESTING-CALLS.md` - Testing procedures
- 🐛 `/CALL-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Debugging help

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Behavior
```
User clicks call button → Shows "Coming Soon" toast → No other action
```

### Future Behavior (When Enabled)
```
User clicks call button → Permission dialog → Media access → Call initiates → WebRTC connection
```

---

## Status: ✅ Working as Intended

The app is now in a clean state where:
- Users can see calling buttons
- Clicking shows friendly "Coming Soon" message
- No errors or broken features
- Easy to enable when ready for production

Perfect for beta testing, gradual rollout, or development! 🚀
