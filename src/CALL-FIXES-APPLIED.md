# 🔧 Call Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Camera/Microphone Permission Errors
**Problem:** Users were getting "NotAllowedError: Permission denied" when trying to make calls.

**Root Cause:** The app was trying to access media devices without properly requesting permissions or explaining to users what was needed.

**Solution:**
1. **Created PermissionRequestDialog** (`/components/PermissionRequestDialog.tsx`)
   - Shows a clear dialog explaining what permissions are needed
   - Lists microphone and camera (for video calls)
   - Provides clear "Grant Permissions" button

2. **Enhanced WebRTC Permission Handling** (`/utils/webrtc.ts`)
   - Added `checkPermissions()` method to pre-check permission status
   - Improved error messages for different permission error types:
     - NotAllowedError → "Permission denied. Please allow access..."
     - NotFoundError → "No camera or microphone found..."
     - NotReadableError → "Camera or microphone is already in use..."
     - And more specific error messages

3. **Updated Call Flow** (`/App.tsx`)
   - Now shows permission dialog BEFORE trying to access media
   - Only requests camera/microphone after user clicks "Grant Permissions"
   - Much better user experience and clearer flow

### ✅ Issue 2: Auth Session Missing Errors
**Problem:** Backend was returning "Auth session missing!" when trying to initiate or manage calls.

**Root Cause:** The session token might be expired or invalid when making call API requests.

**Solution:**
1. **Session Validation Before Calls**
   - Both `handleInitiateCall` and `handleAcceptCall` now verify session validity first
   - Check for session before accessing media devices
   - Show clear error if session is invalid: "Please log out and log back in"

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Proper cleanup if call fails
   - User-friendly toast notifications

## Debugging

### Check Current Permissions
```javascript
// In browser console:
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'camera' })
  .then(result => console.log('Camera:', result.state))

navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'microphone' })
  .then(result => console.log('Microphone:', result.state))
```

### Check Available Devices
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
  .then(devices => {
    console.log('Devices:', devices.filter(d => 
      d.kind === 'audioinput' || d.kind === 'videoinput'
    ))
  })
```

### Check Session
```javascript
// In console:
const supabase = createClient()
supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
  console.log('Session valid:', !!session)
  console.log('Expires:', session?.expires_at ? new Date(session.expires_at * 1000) : 'N/A')
})
```
