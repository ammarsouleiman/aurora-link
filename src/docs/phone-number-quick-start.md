## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Setup (Demo Mode)

The system currently runs in demo mode:
- OTP is generated and logged to console
- OTP is displayed in the UI for testing
- "Email" is sent (logged) but not actually delivered
- Perfect for development and testing

### Production Setup

To enable real email sending, choose an email service:

#### Option 1: Resend (Recommended for Modern Apps)
```typescript
// Install: npm install resend
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'AuroraLink <verify@auroralink.app>',
  to: userProfile.email,
  subject: 'Your AuroraLink Verification Code',
  html: `
    <h2>Phone Number Verification</h2>
    <p>Your verification code is:</p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 32px; letter-spacing: 8px;">${otp}</h1>
    <p>This code will expire in 10 minutes.</p>
  `
});
```

#### Option 2: SendGrid
```typescript
// Install: npm install @sendgrid/mail
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

await sgMail.send({
  to: userProfile.email,
  from: 'verify@auroralink.app',
  subject: 'Your AuroraLink Verification Code',
  html: `<h1>${otp}</h1>`
});
```

#### Option 3: AWS SES
```typescript
// Install: npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
import { SESClient, SendEmailCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-ses';

const ses = new SESClient({ region: 'us-east-1' });

await ses.send(new SendEmailCommand({
  Source: 'verify@auroralink.app',
  Destination: { ToAddresses: [userProfile.email] },
  Message: {
    Subject: { Data: 'Your AuroraLink Verification Code' },
    Body: { 
      Html: { Data: `<h1>${otp}</h1>` }
    }
  }
}));
```
