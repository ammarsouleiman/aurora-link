# Authentication Session Fix - December 2024

## Problem
Users were experiencing `Auth session missing!` errors when the app tried to verify their authentication tokens on the backend. The errors looked like:

```
[verifyUser] ❌ Auth verification error: Auth session missing!
[verifyUser] Error details: {
  name: "AuthSessionMissingError",
  status: 400,
  message: "Auth session missing!"
}
```

## Root Cause
The backend was using an incorrect method to verify JWT tokens. It was creating a user-scoped Supabase client and calling `auth.getUser()`, which requires an active session. This method doesn't work for server-side JWT verification because:

1. The token might be expired or close to expiring
2. The method expects a full session context, not just a JWT
3. It was designed for client-side use, not server-side token validation

## Solution

### Backend Fix (Critical)
**File:** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Creates user-scoped client (doesn't work for JWT verification)
const userSupabase = createClient(
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL') ?? '',
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY') ?? '',
  {
    global: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    }
  }
);
const { data: { user }, error } = await userSupabase.auth.getUser();
```

To:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Uses admin client to verify JWT directly
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token);
```

**Why this works:**
- `supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token)` is designed for server-side JWT verification
- It validates the JWT signature using the service role key
- It doesn't require an active session, just a valid JWT token
- It properly handles expired tokens and returns clear error messages

### Frontend Enhancement
**File:** `/App.tsx`

Added automatic token refresh and retry logic when the backend returns 401:

```typescript
// If backend returns 401, try refreshing the session
if (response.status === 401) {
  console.warn('[Auth] Backend authentication failed, attempting session refresh...');
  
  const { data: refreshData, error: refreshError } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
  
  if (!refreshError && refreshData.session?.access_token) {
    console.log('[Auth] Session refreshed, retrying profile fetch...');
    // Retry the request with refreshed token
    const retryResponse = await fetch(...);
  }
}
```

## Testing
After applying this fix, the authentication flow should work as follows:

1. ✅ User logs in → Frontend gets JWT token
2. ✅ Frontend sends request to backend with JWT in Authorization header
3. ✅ Backend uses admin client to verify JWT token
4. ✅ If token is valid → User is authenticated
5. ✅ If token is expired → Backend returns 401
6. ✅ Frontend automatically refreshes session and retries
7. ✅ If refresh succeeds → Request succeeds
8. ✅ If refresh fails → User is prompted to log in again

## Additional Improvements

### Session Health Monitoring
The app already has session health monitoring that runs every 30 seconds:
- Validates the session exists
- Checks if token is expired
- Proactively refreshes tokens expiring within 5 minutes
- Automatically logs out if session is corrupted

### Token Refresh Strategy
The `getAccessToken()` helper function:
- Checks token expiration before every API call
- Refreshes expired tokens automatically
- Proactively refreshes tokens expiring within 5 minutes
- Returns null for completely invalid sessions

## Expected Behavior
✅ **Session errors should be eliminated** - The backend now properly validates JWTs
✅ **Automatic recovery** - Frontend refreshes tokens when they expire
✅ **Clear error messages** - Users are told when they need to log in again
✅ **Seamless experience** - Token refresh happens automatically in the background

## Monitoring
Check the console logs for these success indicators:
```
[verifyUser] ✅ Successfully verified user: [user-id]
[Auth] ✅ Session refreshed successfully
[API] ✅ Session refreshed successfully, retrying request...
```

If you see errors, check:
1. Is the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY correct in environment variables?
2. Is the JWT token format valid (starts with "eyJ")?
3. Is the token from the correct Supabase project?
4. Has the user's session actually expired and needs re-login?
