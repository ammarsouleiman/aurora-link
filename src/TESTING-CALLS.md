## üîç What to Check

### Console Logs
Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console:

```
[Call] Initiating voice call to User Name
[Call] Remote stream received
[Call] Connected
```

### Network Tab
1. Check API calls to `/calls/initiate`
2. Should see polling to `/calls/incoming`
3. During call: polling to `/calls/{id}/signals`

### Permissions
1. Browser should prompt for permissions
2. Check: `chrome://settings/content/camera`
3. Check: `chrome://settings/content/microphone`

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "No incoming call appears"
**Diagnosis:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify backend is running
- Check polling is active

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In console, manually check:
await fetch('https://{projectId}.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-29f6739b/calls/incoming', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer {token}' }
})
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Diagnosis:**
- Browser blocked camera/microphone

**Fix:**
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Allow camera and microphone
3. Refresh page
4. Try call again

### Issue: "No video/audio"
**Diagnosis:**
- Camera/mic in use by another app
- Wrong device selected
- Hardware issue

**Fix:**
1. Close other apps using camera/mic
2. Check system settings
3. Try different browser
4. Restart device

### Issue: "Call connects but no media"
**Diagnosis:**
- WebRTC connection issue
- Firewall/NAT blocking

**Fix:**
1. Check network settings
2. Try different network
3. Check STUN server accessibility
4. May need TURN server for complex networks

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Expected Metrics:
- **Call setup time**: < 3 seconds
- **Audio latency**: < 200ms
- **Video framerate**: 24-30 fps
- **Signal polling**: Every 1-2 seconds

### How to Measure:
```javascript
// In console during call:
// Check RTCPeerConnection stats
const pc = webrtcManager.current?.getPeerConnection();
const stats = await pc?.getStats();
stats.forEach(stat => console.log(stat));
```
