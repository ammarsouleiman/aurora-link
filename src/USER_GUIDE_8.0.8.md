# AuroraLink Build 8.0.8 - User Guide

## 🎉 What's New

Build 8.0.8 includes a **critical authentication fix** that resolves the "Auth session missing!" errors that some users were experiencing.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: First Login After Update

### What You'll See

When you first open AuroraLink after this update, you'll see the **login screen**, even if you were previously logged in.

**This is completely normal and expected!**

### What You Need to Do

Simply log in again with your email and password:

```
1. Open AuroraLink
2. You'll see the login screen
3. Enter your email address
4. Enter your password
5. Click "Log In"
6. You're back in!
```

### Why This Happens

We've implemented a security update that clears all old authentication data. This is a **one-time occurrence** and ensures everyone starts with a clean, secure session.

---

## ✅ After Logging In

Once you've logged in after the update:

- **Your data is safe** - All your conversations, messages, and contacts are preserved on the server
- **You'll stay logged in** - You won't need to log in again (unless you log out)
- **Everything works normally** - All features function as expected
- **No more errors** - The authentication errors are now fixed

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What Was Cleared

✅ **Cleared (temporary data):**
- Old authentication tokens
- Session cache
- Browser storage

❌ **NOT Cleared (your data is safe):**
- Your messages
- Your conversations
- Your contacts
- Your profile information
- Your media files

All your actual data is safely stored on our servers and will appear immediately after you log in.
