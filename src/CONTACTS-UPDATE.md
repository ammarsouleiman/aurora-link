# Contacts System Update

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Fake/Demo Users

**Before:** The "New Chat" screen showed 5 hardcoded demo contacts:
- Sarah Johnson
- Michael Chen  
- Emily Rodriguez
- David Kim
- Lisa Anderson

**After:** The contacts list is now **empty by default**. Users only appear after you add them via phone number search.

### ✅ Removed Cleanup Buttons

All admin cleanup components and buttons have been removed:
- ❌ QuickCleanupButton (floating red button)
- ❌ AdminCleanup component (from Settings screen)
- ❌ Related documentation files

### How to Add Contacts Now

Since demo contacts are removed, here's how to add real contacts:

1. **Click "New Chat"** from the home screen
2. **Click "Find by Phone Number"** button
3. **Enter a phone number** (in E.164 format, e.g., +14155551234)
4. **Click "Find User"**
5. If found, a chat will automatically start with that user
6. The user will be added to your contacts list

### Current Behavior

**New Chat Screen shows:**
- 🔍 Search bar (to filter added contacts)
- 📞 "Find by Phone Number" button
- 📭 Empty state with message: "No contacts yet - Use 'Find by Phone Number' to add contacts and start chatting"

**After adding contacts via phone:**
- ✓ Contacts appear in the list
- ✓ You can search/filter them
- ✓ You can select them to start chats
- ✓ You can select multiple for group chats

### Phone Number Format

Remember: All phone numbers must be in **E.164 format**:
- ✅ `+14155551234` (USA)
- ✅ `+442071234567` (UK)
- ✅ `+919876543210` (India)
- ❌ `(415) 555-1234` (invalid)
- ❌ `555-1234` (invalid)

### Adding Test Users

To test the app, you need to:

1. **Create multiple accounts** (sign up with different emails/passwords/phone numbers)
2. **Log in with Account A**
3. **Use "Find by Phone Number"** to find Account B by its phone number
4. **Start chatting!**

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `/App.tsx` - Removed QuickCleanupButton import and usage
- `/components/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` - Removed AdminCleanup import and section
- `/components/screens/NewChatScreen.tsx` - Removed sampleContacts array, improved empty state

**Files Deleted:**
- `/components/QuickCleanupButton.tsx`
- `/components/AdminCleanup.tsx`
- `/HOW-TO-CLEAN-DATABASE.md`
- `/ADMIN-CLEANUP.md`

**Backend Endpoint Still Available:**
The `/admin/delete-all-users` endpoint still exists in the backend if you ever need to clean the database programmatically. You can call it via:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-29f6739b/admin/delete-all-users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

---

**Result:** Your New Chat screen now shows a clean, empty contacts list. Users must be added by searching for their phone numbers, making it a true production-ready experience!
